## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv(unz('activity.zip', 'activity.csv'), sep = ',')
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = '%Y-%m-%d')
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
activity_bydate <- activity %>%
        group_by(date) %>%
        summarise_all(sum)
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(data = activity_bydate, aes(x = date, y = steps))
g + geom_bar(stat = 'identity')

```

### Mean total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(activity_bydate$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
### Median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
median(activity_bydate$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
